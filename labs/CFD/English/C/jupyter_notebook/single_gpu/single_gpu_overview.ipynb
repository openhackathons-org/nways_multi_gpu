    "# Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review the scientific problem for which the Jacobi solver application has been developed.\n",
    "* Understand the single-GPU code of the application.\n",
    "* Learn about NVIDIA Nsight Systems profiler and how to use it to analyze our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the scientific problem we focus on and the solver we employ. Then, we execute the single GPU version of the application program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Laplace Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Laplace Equation is a well-studied linear partial differential equation that governs steady state heat conduction, irrotational fluid flow, and many other phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will consider the 2D Laplace Equation on a rectangle with [Dirichlet boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_boundary_condition) on the left and right boundary and periodic boundary conditions on top and bottom boundary. We wish to solve the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta u(x,y) = 0\\;\\forall\\;(x,y)\\in\\Omega,\\delta\\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jacobi Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm to solve a linear system of strictly diagonally dominant equations. The governing Laplace equation is discretized and converted to a matrix amenable to Jacobi-method based solver. The pseudo code for Jacobi iterative process can be seen in diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![gpu_programming_process](../../images/jacobi_algo.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer loop defines the convergence point, which could either be defined as reaching max number of iterations or when [L2 Norm](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-73003-5_1070) reaches a max/min value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPU processing flow in general follows 3 key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy data from CPU to GPU\n",
    "2. Launch GPU Kernel\n",
    "3. Copy processed data back to CPU from GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "![gpu_programming_process](../../images/gpu_programming_process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the same 3 steps in our code. Let's understand the single-GPU code first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The source code file, [jacobi.cu](../../source_code/single_gpu/jacobi.cu) (click to open), is present in `CFD/English/C/source_code/single_gpu/` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can navigate to `CFD/English/C/source_code/single_gpu/` directory in Jupyter's file browser in the left pane. Then, click to open the `jacobi.cu` file as shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Refer to the `single_gpu(...)` function. The important steps at each iteration of the Jacobi Solver inside `while` loop are:\n",
    "1. The norm is set to 0 using `cudaMemset`.\n",
    "2. The device kernel `jacobi_kernel` is called to update the interier points.\n",
    "3. The norm is copied back to the host using `cudaMemcpy` (DtoH), and\n",
    "4. The periodic boundary conditions are re-applied for the next iteration using `cudaMemcpy` (DtoD).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "While the program in our labs gives the execution time in its output, it may not always be convinient to time the execution from within the program. Moreover, just timing the execution does not reveal the bottlenecks directly. For that purpose, we profile the program with NVIDIA's Nsight Systems profiler's command-line interface (CLI), `nsys`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### NVIDIA Nsight Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Nsight Systems profiler offers system-wide performance analysis in order to visualize applicationâ€™s execution timeline and help identify optimization opportunities on a system with multiple CPUs and GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nsight Systems timeline](../../images/nsys_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The highlighted portions are identified as follows:\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red\">Red</span>: The CPU row provides thread-level core utilization data. \n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">Blue</span>: The CUDA HW row displays GPU kernel and memory transfer activities and API calls.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:orange\">Orange</span>: The Threads row gives a detailed view of each CPU thread's activity including from OS runtime libraries, MPI, NVTX, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `nsys` CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "We will profile the application using `nsys` CLI. Here's a typical `nsys` command to profile a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx --stats=true -o jacobi_report --force-overwrite true ./jacobi`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--trace` flag specifies that we want to trace CUDA and NVTX APIs (in addition to baseline tracing), `--stats` specifies that we want to generate a statistics summary after profiling, and `-o` allows us to name the report file (which will include the `.nsys-rep` extension). The `--force-overwrite` flag allows us to overwrite an existing report (of the same name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can always use the `nsys --help` to know more about these and other available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing the Report\n",
    "\n",
    "One can view the profiling report by using Nsight Systems GUI. Note that CUDA toolkit and the GUI application of the same version as CLI are required. Follow these steps:\n",
    "* Open Nsight Systems GUI application.\n",
    "* Click on _file $\\rightarrow$ open_.\n",
    "* Browse and select the `.nsys-rep` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can enable the `--stats` flag to display profiling data on the terminal (refer to the image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![nsys cli sample output](../../images/nsys_cli_sample_output.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVIDIA Tools Extension (NVTX)\n",
    "\n",
    "NVTX is C-based API for annotating events in applications. It is useful for profiling both specific events and large code blocks. We will routinely make use of NVTX APIs to instrument our application for `nsys` profiler. It helps `nsys` in collecting relevant information and improves the application timeline's readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use NVTX, follow these steps:\n",
    "* `#include <nvToolsExt.h>` in the code file\n",
    "* Insert `nvtxRangePush(\"myCodeBlock\");` just before the code block begins and `nvtxRangePop();` just after it ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, go back to the [jacobi.cu](../../source_code/single_gpu/jacobi.cu) source code file and correlate the \"Jacobi solve\" annotated event visible on both the `nsys` CLI statistics and the GUI-based timeline to its use in the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code can be taken up for optimizations. We will follow the cyclic process to optimize our code and get best scaling results across multiple GPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analyze** the code using profilers to identify bottlenecks and hotspots.\n",
    "* **Parallelize** the routines where most of the time in the code is spent.\n",
    "* **Optimize** the parallel code by analyzing first for opportunities, applying optimizations, verifying our gains, and repeating the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the performance gain, we denote the single-GPU execution time as $T_s$ and multi-GPU execution time for $P$ GPUs as $T_p$. Using this, we obtain the figures-of-merit:\n",
    "* Speedup $S = T_s/T_p$ (optimal is $P$), and \n",
